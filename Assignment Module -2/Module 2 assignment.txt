           (4) How memory is managed in python?
                   Understanding Memory allocation is important to any software developer as 
                   writing efficient code means writing a memory-efficient code. Memory 
                   allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer 
                   memory to a program.


           (5) What is the purpose continuing statement in python?
                   The continue statement is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the 
                   current iteration only. For instance, let's use continue instead of a break 
                   statement in the previous example. When the condition num == 5 becomes 
                   True, the continue statement gets executed.


          (14) What are negative indexes and why are they used?
                  Negative indexing is used in Python to manipulate sequence objects such as 
                  lists, arrays, strings, etc. 
                  Negative indexing retrieves elements from the end by providing negative 
                  numbers as sequence indexes
